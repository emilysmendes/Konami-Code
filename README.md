# Konami-Code

The Konami Code was a cheat code that appeared in a number of games from Konami. Contra was one of the early NES games to have featured the Konami Code. Contra would start you with 3 lives per game, but after the start screen, if you entered the Konami Code, you would get 30 lives! The Konami Code: Up, Up, Down, Down, Left, Right, Left, Right, B, A ( ↑ ↑ ↓ ↓ ← → ← → B A ). This code will log a number reference that is tied to each key that is entered on your keyboard. Open the console and view the output as you type on the keyboard.
